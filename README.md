# Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

This code is taken from the video [Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQt0CLXXAqg&t=337s&ab_channel=mildlyoverfitted)

To run this file
```
./parallel_launch.sh
```
The aim of this project is to see how many parameter can be pruned from a simple 
neural network while maintaining its accuracy

To run a single iteration
```
python main.py --help
```
More experiments are coming soon in this repository based on different Pruning methods
